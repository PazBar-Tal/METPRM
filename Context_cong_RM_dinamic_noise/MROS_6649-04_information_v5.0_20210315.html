	<p>You are being invited to take part in a research study.  Before you decide to take part it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what participation will involve.  Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish.  Please ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information by contacting us at <i>paz.bartal.24@ucl.ac.uk</i>.  Please take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part. 

<br><br>
<strong>What is the purpose of the research?</strong><br>
Our research is trying to understand how the mind of adult humans works – for example, how it allows us to see, pay attention, think, read and speak, learn and remember, imagine, navigate around in the world, interact with other people, solve problems, and feel. If we can understand how these vital functions are supported by the mind of healthy individuals, in the future we may be able to do more to help patients who have difficulties in these domains. This study aims to improve our understanding of these processes by asking volunteers to perform simple computer-based tasks and answer questionnaires online. Performing studies online rather than in the laboratory renders participation much simpler and takes less time. This allows us to include a greater number of participants, and thus to improve the quality of our results.

In this specific project, we study the border between imagery and perception.

<br><br>
<strong>Why have I been chosen?</strong><br>
You are invited to take part if you are over 18 years of age, and have no medical or mental condition that impairs your decision-making. Specifically, you should not take part if you have a known dementia, a cognitive impairment of any sort (including due to medical illness), schizophrenia, or an acute episode of depression.

<br><br>
<strong>Do I have to take part?</strong><br>
It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part.  If you do decide to take part you can download this information sheet and be asked to agree to participation on the next page. You can withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without any disadvantage for you. If you interrupt a session by simply closing the web browser, you will not receive reimbursement for this session. However, we will always reimburse you for sessions that you have completed, even if you withdraw from the study. We will not rate you negatively or comment on your withdrawal on recruitment platforms in case you choose to withdraw. If you withdraw after consenting, we will keep your anonymous data unless you conctact us and instruct us to delete them. 

<br><br>
<strong>What does the study involve?</strong><br>
You will be asked to perform a simple task on your computer. You will be asked to observe different images and answer follow-up questions. During the experiment you will occasionally be asked to imagine specific objects and project them on the image. Your responses and button presses will be recorded.

You may also be asked to answer some simple questions about yourself and your experience of the tasks. 

Full instructions and training will be provided before the experiment begins. There are no anticipated risks or benefits associated with participating in this study.

The study will be comprised of <i>one</i> session of approximately <i>40-60</i> minutes duration.


<br><br>
<strong>Will I be recorded and how will the recorded media be used?</strong><br>

You will not be recorded in this study.

<br><br>
<strong>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?</strong><br>
You will disclose information to us, and the paragraph below "What happens to my data" details the potential disadvantages of this. There are no further known risks associated with taking part in this study. 

<br><br>
<strong>Are there any benefits to taking part?</strong><br>
There will be no direct benefit to you from taking part in this research. However, your data may contribute important theoretical information to our understanding of how the brain and cognition works.

<br><br>
<strong>What if something goes wrong?</strong><br>
Should you wish to raise a complaint then please email <i>paz.bartal.24@ucl.ac.uk</i>. Should you feel your complaint has not been handled to your satisfaction then you can contact the Chair of the UCL Research Ethics Committee – ethics@ucl.ac.uk.  


<br><br>
<strong>What happens to my data?</strong><br>
All your data is fully anonymous. We do not store any personal information. Your data is linked to a personal identifier (a secret combination of numbers and letters) that is unknown to us. This identifier is your Prolific ID. We will receive your data together with this identifier. We cannot know who owns this identifier unless you disclose it to us or to anybody else. Your payment information will be sent to the online market place referring to your identifier. The online market place can link your identifier to any personal information you have given to them, but they have an obligation to protect these data from unauthorised access. We only work with market places that are GDPR-compliant. 

<br><br> To help future research and make the best use of the research data you have given us (such as answers to questionnaires) we may keep your research data indefinitely and share these. The data we collect will be shared and held as follows:<br>
•	We may share your anonymous data with collaborating researchers that commit to the same data protection safeguards as we do.<br>
•       In publications, your data will be combined with the data of others, so you cannot be identified.<br>
•	In public databases, your data will be reduced in a way that makes statistical identification impossible. <br><br>

We will store the following types of anonymous data:
<br>
•	responses and button presses in the experiment<br>
•	questionnaire responses<br>

<br>We never process any personal data. The legal basis used to process your anonymous data is that the research you are taking part in is deemed to be in the public interest. The legal basis used to process data about your personality, political opinions and/or mental health (classified as "special category data" according to GDPR) will be for purposes of scientific research. We will follow UCL and legal guidelines to safeguard your data. 

The controller for this project will be University College London (UCL). The UCL Data Protection Officer provides oversight of UCL activities involving the processing of personal data, and can be contacted at data-protection@ucl.ac.uk. If you are concerned about how your personal data is being processed, or if you would like to contact us about your rights, please contact UCL in the first instance at data-protection@ucl.ac.uk. Further information on how UCL uses participant information can be found here:

<br><br>
<strong>Who funds this research?</strong><br>
Our work is funded by medical charities such as the Wellcome Trust, and government bodies such as the Medical Research Council, and the European Union.

<br><br>
<strong>Who has reviewed this research?</strong><br>
A Research Ethics Committee reviews all proposals for research using human participants before they can proceed. This research has been approved by the University College London Research Ethics Committee.

<br><br>
<strong>What do I do if I do not want to take part anymore?</strong><br>
You can stop taking part at any time and without giving a reason. If you withdraw from this study, you can still take part in the other studies. Any research data that we have already collected may still be used, unless you request that it is destroyed.  However, once unidentifiable data and research results have been shared with others, it may not be possible for them to be destroyed, withdrawn or recalled.  

If you change your mind and withdraw your consent to participate in this study or want your data deleted please contact us at <i>paz.bartal.24@ucl.ac.uk</i>. You will need to know your personal ID to do so, but for security reasons we advise that you never put this ID into an email.
